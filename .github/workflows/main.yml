# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build-and-deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # Checkout,获取源码，使用的action是GitHub官方的actions/checkout
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
          
      - name: Install and Build   # 安装依赖、打包，如果提前已打包好无需这一步
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build-only

      - name: Deploy   # 部署
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.3.3 # 使用第三方action，有两个参数：branch,folder
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # 部署后提交到那个分支
          folder: dist # 这里填打包好的目录名称
